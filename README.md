# `darkmode`

Small script for toggling the color mode on Linux. Simply run `darkmode`.

Tip: Set a keyboard shortcut, such as Super+F12, for the command for quick toggling.

## Installing

Clone the repository and run the `install.sh`-script. Needs root rights for writing into `/usr/bin`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukasmerk/darkmode
cd darkmode
./install.sh
```

After that, the cloned repository can be deleted, the script lives in `/usr/bin`, the config files in `~/.config/darkmode/`.

## Uninstalling

If needed, clone the repository again, and run `uninstall.sh`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukasmerk/darkmode
cd darkmode
./uninstall.sh
```
